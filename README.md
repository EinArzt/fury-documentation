## Getting Started

In this section you will find the basic folder structure and everything you need to get the theme up and running the first time to start developing.

### Folder Structure

| Name        | Description      
| ------------- |---------------|
| `angular-cli.json` | Used for configuration of project specific settings. You can add external styles and scripts, change the output folder, add assets, add environment files and more. | 
| `e2e`              | Will be used for end-to-end tests to ensure functionality for users before deploying.      |
| `node_modules`      | All external modules used are here. Do not mess with this folder, as it is auto-generated by using `npm install`.      |
| `package.json`      | Contains all dependencies used for production and development. |
| `src`      | Contains all Angular 2 Typescript code, assets and basically everything the end user will have access to. |
| `tslint.json`      | Angular-CLI includes an automatic Typescript-Linter, which can be configured with this file. |
